## Database Models

### Competition
```python
class Competition(db.Model):
    # Core configuration
    event_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('shooting_event.id'))
    number_of_rounds = db.Column(db.Integer, default=6)
    target_size_cm = db.Column(db.Integer, default=122)
    arrows_per_round = db.Column(db.Integer, default=6)
    max_team_size = db.Column(db.Integer, default=4)
    status = db.Column(db.String(20), default='setup')
```

**Status Values:**
- `setup`: Initial creation, parameters being configured
- `registration_open`: Accepting participant registrations
- `in_progress`: Competition active, scoring in progress
- `completed`: Competition finished, results finalized

### CompetitionGroup
Age or skill-based categories within a competition:
```python
class CompetitionGroup(db.Model):
    name = db.Column(db.String(100))  # "Adults", "Juniors", "Seniors"
    min_age = db.Column(db.Integer)   # Optional age restrictions
    max_age = db.Column(db.Integer)   # Optional age restrictions
```

### CompetitionTeam
Teams within groups for collaborative scoring:
```python
class CompetitionTeam(db.Model):
    group_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('competition_group.id'))
    team_number = db.Column(db.Integer)  # Team 1, 2, 3, etc.
    target_number = db.Column(db.Integer)  # Target assignment
```

### CompetitionRegistration
Individual participant entries:
```python
class CompetitionRegistration(db.Model):
    competition_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('competition.id'))
    member_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))
    group_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('competition_group.id'))
    team_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('competition_team.id'))
```

### ArrowScore
Individual arrow scoring records:
```python
class ArrowScore(db.Model):
    registration_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('competition_registration.id'))
    arrow_number = db.Column(db.Integer)  # Sequential arrow number
    points = db.Column(db.Integer)        # 0-10 points
    is_x = db.Column(db.Boolean)          # Inner X-ring hit
    round_number = db.Column(db.Integer)  # Which round
    recorded_by = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))
```

## Competition Flow

### 1. Competition Creation
1. Admin creates competition linked to shooting event
2. Configure rounds, arrows per round, target size
3. Set maximum team size (3 or 4 members)

### 2. Group Setup
1. Create competition groups (e.g., "Adults", "Juniors")
2. Set age restrictions if applicable
3. Groups organize participants for fair competition

### 3. Registration Phase
1. Competition status set to `registration_open`
2. Members can register for competition
3. Admin assigns participants to appropriate groups

### 4. Team Generation
1. Algorithm distributes group members into teams
2. Teams assigned to specific targets
3. Ensures balanced team sizes within max_team_size

### 5. Competition Start
1. Status changed to `in_progress`
2. Scoring interface becomes available
3. Teams shoot at assigned targets

### 6. Scoring Process
1. Admins access scoring management interface
2. Individual participant scoring forms available
3. Real-time progress tracking and validation
4. Round-by-round score entry with X-ring tracking

### 7. Competition Completion
1. Admin marks competition as `completed`
2. Missing arrows automatically filled with 0-point scores
3. Final results calculated and rankings determined

## Scoring Rules

### Arrow Scoring
- **Points Range**: 0-10 points per arrow
- **X-Ring**: Inner ring of 10-point zone (for tie-breaking)
- **Validation**: Client-side and server-side score validation

### Round Calculation
- **Total per Round**: Sum of all arrows in the round
- **Maximum per Round**: arrows_per_round ร 10 points
- **Progress Tracking**: Completed rounds vs. total rounds

### Competition Totals

## Scoring Interface Implementation

### Button-Based Scoring System

The competition scoring system uses a modern button-based interface instead of traditional dropdown selections:

#### Interface Design
- **One row per arrow**: Each arrow gets its own scoring row
- **Numbered buttons 1-10**: Visual buttons for each possible score value
- **X-ring checkbox**: Separate checkbox for inner X-ring hits on score 10
- **Visual feedback**: Selected buttons highlighted with Bootstrap styling
- **JavaScript enhancement**: Dynamic button state management

#### Technical Implementation

**HTML Structure**:
```html
<div class="arrow-row mb-2">
    <label class="form-label">Arrow {{ loop.index }}:</label>
    <div class="score-buttons">
        {% for score in range(1, 11) %}
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-score me-1" 
                    data-arrow="{{ loop0.index }}" data-score="{{ score }}">
                {{ score }}
            </button>
        {% endfor %}
        <div class="form-check form-check-inline ms-2">
            <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" 
                   id="x_{{ loop0.index }}" name="x_{{ loop0.index }}">
            <label class="form-check-label" for="x_{{ loop0.index }}">X</label>
        </div>
    </div>
    <input type="hidden" name="arrow_{{ loop0.index }}" id="arrow_{{ loop0.index }}" value="">
</div>
```

**JavaScript Button Management**:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const scoreButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.btn-score');
    
    scoreButtons.forEach(button => {
        button.addEventListener('click', function() {
            const arrow = this.dataset.arrow;
            const score = this.dataset.score;
            
            // Clear other buttons in this row
            const rowButtons = document.querySelectorAll(`[data-arrow="${arrow}"]`);
            rowButtons.forEach(btn => {
                btn.classList.remove('btn-primary');
                btn.classList.add('btn-outline-primary');
            });
            
            // Highlight selected button
            this.classList.remove('btn-outline-primary');
            this.classList.add('btn-primary');
            
            // Set hidden field value
            document.getElementById(`arrow_${arrow}`).value = score;
        });
    });
});
```

#### Form Processing

**Flask Route**: Processes scoring form submissions
```python
@bp.route('/<int:competition_id>/score/<int:registration_id>', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def submit_score(competition_id, registration_id):
    # Process button-selected scores
    for i in range(arrows_per_round):
        score = request.form.get(f'arrow_{i}', '0')
        is_x = f'x_{i}' in request.form
        
        # Save arrow score to database
        arrow_score = ArrowScore(
            registration_id=registration_id,
            arrow_number=current_arrow + i,
            points=int(score) if score else 0,
            is_x=is_x and score == '10',
            round_number=current_round,
            recorded_by=current_user.id
        )
        db.session.add(arrow_score)
    
    db.session.commit()
    return redirect(url_for('competitions.scoring', id=competition_id))
```

#### User Experience Benefits

1. **Faster Input**: Click buttons instead of dropdown navigation
2. **Visual Clarity**: Clear indication of selected scores
3. **Error Prevention**: Impossible to select invalid scores
4. **Mobile Friendly**: Large touch targets for mobile devices
5. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

#### Validation & Error Handling

- **Client-side**: JavaScript validates all arrows have scores before submission
- **Server-side**: Flask validates score ranges (0-10) and data integrity
- **Error Display**: Bootstrap alerts for validation failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators for completion status

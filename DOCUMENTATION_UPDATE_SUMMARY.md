- **Bootstrap UI**: Responsive web interface with modern design

#### Key Features Documented
- **Button-based Competition Scoring**: Numbered buttons with JavaScript enhancement
- **Dynamic Inventory Forms**: Category-specific fields loaded via JSON API
- **Bow Attributes**: Handedness, length (inches), draw weight (pounds)
- **Session Security**: Role-based access control with Flask-Login
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms protected against CSRF attacks

## Documentation Accuracy

### ✅ Now Accurate
- System architecture type (web app vs. API)
- Feature implementation details
- Technology stack and dependencies
- User interface components and interactions
- Database models and relationships
- Form handling and validation
- Security and authentication methods

### ⚠️ Marked as Outdated
- API documentation (api.md) - clearly marked as not implemented
- Any references to JSON/REST API functionality
- Real-time features (clarified as form-based)

## For Users

### Developers
- Review [web-interface.md](documentation/web-interface.md) for actual route implementation
- Check [competitions.md](documentation/competitions.md) for button-based scoring details
- See [inventory.md](documentation/inventory.md) for dynamic form system

### System Administrators
- Use updated README.md for accurate installation instructions
- Follow [configuration.md](documentation/configuration.md) for environment setup
- Reference [deployment.md](documentation/deployment.md) for production deployment

### Users
- System remains fully functional as web application
- All features accessible through browser interface
- No changes required for current usage patterns

## Summary

The documentation now accurately reflects the Nockpoint system as a **traditional web application** with HTML-based interfaces, not a REST API system. All feature descriptions, technical details, and implementation specifics have been updated to match the actual codebase.

Key improvements:
- ✅ Accurate system architecture documentation
- ✅ Detailed button-based scoring interface documentation  
- ✅ Comprehensive dynamic form system documentation
- ✅ Clear distinction between web interface and limited JSON endpoints
- ✅ Updated installation and development instructions
- ✅ Proper warnings about outdated API documentation
